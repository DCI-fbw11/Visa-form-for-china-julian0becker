1. You should not put all form elements on one page. Divide it into 4 pages. Navigate through pages with "next page" , "previous page" button. 

2. Focus on user-friendly GUI and multiple access-points.
Provide links of all pages on navigation bar on the top of page. 
Provide "Next page" and "Previous page" on both header and footer.

3. Provide access to the different sections (fieldset) of form on the left section of your form.

4. Style your form as you like. (i.e., page layout using grid, flex or float )

6. Consider about different screen-sizes. Provide atleast 2 media-queries. Ideally, your form should look good on all sizes of devices.
